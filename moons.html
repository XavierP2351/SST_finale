            <div class="text">
                <p>Earth's moon! It's been around for a very long time; almost the entirety of Earth's existence too. 
                    Some other facts are: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Formed by a collison between the Earth and Theia, a Mars-sized object from space. That collison led to material flying, and the moon is one of the pieces</li>
                    <li>2. It's only called "The Moon" because no one knew other moons existed until 1610 when Galileo dicovered 4 Jupiter moons</li>
                    <li>3. Only one side of the Moon is shown to the Earth at all times</li>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Earth's second Moon...except not really. It's a temporary mini-moon that got caught by our gravitational pull Sept. 29, 2024. 
                    Some other facts are: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. The "mini-moon" is actually the tiny asteroid named "2024 PT5"</li>
                    <li>2. Lasted until November 25, 2024 at 15:43 UTC</li>
                    <li>3. Belongs to the Arjuna asteroid belt, a belt that orbits the Sun 93 million miles away</li>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Deimos is the smaller moon of Mars, being 9 by 7 by 6.8 miles in size. Some other facts are: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. It orbits Mars every 30 hours</li>
                    <li>2. It's much farther away from Mars, about 14,580 miles away</li>
                    <li>3. It takes about 30.3 hours for it to orbit Mars</li>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Since Deimos is the smaller moon, Phobos is clearly the bigger one, being 17 x 14 x 11 miles in size. Some other facts about Phobos are: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. It orbits Mars 3 times a Earth day</li>
                    <li>2. The big crater on the moon is called the Stickney Crater, named after the wife of the man who doscovered the moon, aka Chloe Angeline Stickney Hall</li>
                    <li>3. It's ~3,700 miles from Mars, which is almost the length of China from North to south (~3,400 miles)</li>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Ganymede, known for being the biggest moon that Jupiter holds and the biggest moon in the solar system, being larger than Mercury. Some other facts are 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Despite having old lava flows, its tempature ranges from -297 to -171 degrees F</li>
                    <li>2. It has its own magnetic field</li>
                    <li>3. Supposedly has more water stored than Earth has, and possibly in layers too</li>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Callisto has always been considered a "Dead Moon" for its inactive geological activity. However, data from the Galileo spacecraft during the 1990s suggests there actually might be a ocean under the surface. 
                    Some other facts are: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. It's the most heavily cratered space object in the solar system</li>
                    <li>2. 3rd largest moon in the solar system</li>
                    <li>3. Due to there possibly being a ocean deep into Callisto, the moon may be habitable for life</li>

                <p>Io is, by far, one of the most active moons, with so much volcanic activity that it practically changed the way it looks entirely. Some other facts are: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Io's volcanic eruptions that they are seen with large telescopes on Earth</li>
                    <li>2. Io is tidally locked just like Earth's natural moon</li>
                    <li>3. Has the strongest surface gravity due to the volcanos</li>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Titan is Saturn's largest moon, and despite it's golden hue, which is just its atmosphere, it's a very icy moon. Some other facts are: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Is larger than the planet Mercury and almost as big as Ganymede</li>
                    <li>2. Its surface is one of the most Earthlike places, ignoring the extreme cold</li>
                    <li>3. Is the only moon in the solar system with a thick atmosphere</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>1. Has a sponge like surface with so many craters, including a 200 meter wide crater</li>
                    <li>2. Has a eccentric orbit, meaning that its orbit is unpredictable and more chaotic</li>
                    <li>3. 3 people are credited with the discovery of Hyperion in 1848, with their names being: William Lassell, William Cranch Bond, and George Phillips</li>
