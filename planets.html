                <p>This is the planet Mercury! It is the closest planet to the sun while also being the fastest and smallest planet in the solar system

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. It's rotated by 2 degrees, making it almost upright at all times</li>        <!--Instead of a ordered list, this must be the way to avoid getting the text in the image-->
                    <li>2. Because it's almost upright, it doesn't experience any seasons</li>
                    <li>3. Its surface is similar to our moon</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>1. It spins slowly spins in the opposite direction from most planets</li>
                    <li>2. Is dubbed "Earth's evil twin" for its similar structure and size of Earth</li>

                    <li>2. Within the "Goldilocks zone" from the Sun, where temperatures make it suitable for liquid water to exist</li>
                    <li>3. Its moon is slowly drifitng away, which isn't much of a worry since it doesn't move that fast </li>

                <p>This is the planet Mars! We've explored this planet far more than the rest, since it's the only planet that won't melt our rovers and is nearby.
                    It used to be a much warmer and wetter planet, but now it's nothing but a cold desert. Some other facts are:

                <ul>
                    <li>1. Is about half the size of Earth</li>
                    <li>2. Its day is very close to ours (24.6 hrs compared to Earth's 23.9 hrs)</li>
                    <li>3. Has 95 moons offically </li>

                    <li>2. The Great Red Spot is actually a storm bigger than Earth</li>
                    <li>3. Though itself most likely doesn't support life, Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, could due to a ocean existing on that moon</li>

                    <li>3. The rings extend to 175,000 miles long, yet are 30 feet in vertical height</li>

                </p>
                <ul>

                    <li>2. Uranus actually has faint rings that come from the collison of moons that once orbited Uranus</li>
                    <li>3. Its day is 17 hours, yet its year is about 84 Earth years</li>
