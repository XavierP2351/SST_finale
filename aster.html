                <p>This is Bennu, also known as 101955 Bennu or 1999 RQ36! It's a near-Earth asteroid that was discovered in 1999 by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research team. Some other facts are: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission arrived at Bennu on December 3, 2018</li>
                    <li>2. Considered a ancient relic of the "early days" of our solar system, with scientists thinking it was already made 10 million years after the formation of our solar system</li>
                    <li>3. Then particles that make up the surface are so loosely packed that if someone were to step on Bennu, they would sink into the asteroid</li>

                <p>This is Ceres, the first discovered asteroid ever in 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi! It's also the largest object in the asteroid belt. Some other facts are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Was considered a asteroid before reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006</li>
                    <li>2. NASA's first true "interplanetary spaceship" landed on Ceres in 2015, being the first dwarf planet to ever receive a visit from a spacecraft</li>
                    <li>3. its day is about 9 hours long, being one of the shortest days in the solar system</li>

                <p>Pallas is the 3rd largest asteroid, found in between Mars and Jupiter. Some other facts are: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. It's denser than Ceres yet less dense than Vesta </li>
                    <li>2. Its day is about 7.8 hours</li>
                    <li>3. Holds a theory that Pallas could be a "remnant protoplanet" could've been a planet if under different conditions</li>

                <p>Vesta is the second largest asteroid in between Mars and Jupiter. In fact, it's nearly considered a dwarf planet too. Some other facts are: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. It has its own crust, mantle, and core, making it very different from the rest</li>
                    <li>2. NASAâ€™s Dawn spacecraft circled Vesta from July 16, 2011 to Sept. 5, 2012 until it left for Ceres</li>
                    <li>3. Formed within the first 1-2 millions years from the formation of the solar system</li>
